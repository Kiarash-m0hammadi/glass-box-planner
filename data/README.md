# Data for "The Glass Box Planner" Project

This document provides details for the primary geospatial dataset used in the paper, *"The Glass Box Planner: An Open-Source Framework for Transparent Pairwise Compatibility Analysis in Urban Planning."*

To comply with the AGILE Reproducible Paper Guidelines and FAIR data principles, the dataset is not stored in this code repository. Instead, it is permanently archived on Zenodo to ensure long-term availability, versioning, and a stable Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

## Dataset Details

*   **Source:** The data was originally sourced from the Qazvin Municipal Planning Office (2012).
*   **Content:** The Zenodo archive (`gis_qazvin.zip`) contains an ESRI Shapefile (`.shp`) and its associated sidecar files.
*   **Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** WGS 84 / UTM zone 39N (EPSG:32639).
*   **Pre-processing:** The raw data was validated to repair any invalid geometries. The land-use taxonomy in the attribute table was standardized to match the schema defined in this project's [`COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md`](../COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md).
